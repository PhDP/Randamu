randamu is a small MIT-licensed C library that includes a high-quality random
number generator. The code is based on WELL1024, a new random generator with a
better distribution than the mersenne twister, and is tested against a sequence
generated by the authors of the algorithm (which includes the creator of the
mersenne twister).

Other functions and algorithms related to probability theory and statistics are
also included. The bogosort algorithm is a joke (don't use it!), but everything
else is not.

Note: there is no C++ in this code, github is mislabelling some header files.

Installing
----------
On Linux or UNIX-like systems:

    $ git clone https://github.com/PhDP/randamu.git
    $ cd randamu
    $ cmake .
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

To launch tests simply add:

    $ make test

after 'make'.

You can generate Visual Studio project files with cmake, which can 
be installed with [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), and using the
command

    $ cmake .

at the root of the randamu directory. To run the tests, simply build
the RUN_TESTS project in Visual Studio.

Usage
-----
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <time.h>
    #include <randamu/rng.h>

    int main() {
      const clock_t start = clock();
      rd_rng r; // A random number generator.
      rd_rng_init_time(&r); // Initialize with the current time.
      const int max = 2000000000;
      int success = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < max; ++i) {
        // Creates points in the unit square:
        const double x = rd_rng_double(&r);
        const double y = rd_rng_double(&r);
        // Tests if they are within the unit circle:
        success += (x * x + y * y) < 1.0;
      }
      // Print estimate of pi:
      printf("Pi ~= %f!\n", 4.0 * success / max);
      printf("Time: %.4f seconds.\n", ((double)(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC));
      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

...will compile with:

    $ clang -Wall -std=c99 -O2 random.c -o random -lrandamu -lm

Of course 'gcc' or another compiler can be used. On an Intel Core i7-4702HQ
with clang 3.5, this code takes 21.8164 seconds, a ~9% improvement over gsl
with the mersenne twister, and you don't need to adopt the GPL license.
