randamu is a small C library that includes a high-quality random number
generator, plus a few probabilistic data-structures, functions for statistics
and handling probabilities.

The bogosort random algorithm is a joke (don't use it!), but everything else is
not. The bloom filter (a probabilistic data structure), is arguably one of the
most original and useful data structure.
